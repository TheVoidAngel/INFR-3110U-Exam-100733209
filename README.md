5) Object pooling was implemented by setting up a pool with a ghost model prefab which would be set to deactive upon starting the project. When the player presses the 1 button on the keyboard one of the ghosts would activate and become visble within the scene (press 2 to deactivate). This type of impelentation optomizes the game so that the ghost can be activated and deactivated at will without disrupting performance by creating and distrying multiple.

6) Using the command design pattern you can undo the last 7 pellets by pressing the spacebar. This helps the Pac-Man style game as it allows for the player to reset and earn more points for that run.

7) I would implemnt a sound manager which would hold all of the sounds to be used when needed by obserevers and other design patterns. This works well with the idea of a Pac-Man style game as the sounds would need to be interchanged quickly and efficiently thoughout the game. This goes for the background music and the sound effects such as the ghosts, pellets, and pac-man himself. Overall the use of a sound manager would help the game run efficiantly even when a lot of sounds are in play.
